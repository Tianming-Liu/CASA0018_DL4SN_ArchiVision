## Understanding Architectural Style through Deep Learning

## Overview
This repository contains a deep learning application for the classification of western architectural styles. It is designed to identify and categorize images of buildings into Gothic, Classic, and Byzantine styles. The codebase includes scripts for web image crawling, model training in Colab, and deployment on mobile devices using Flutter.

## Dataset
The `Data` directory is organized into three subdirectories, each containing images corresponding to one of the architectural styles:
- `Gothic_Data`
- `Classic_Data`
- `Byzantine_Data`

## Code Structure
The `Code` directory is divided into three main components:
- `Model_Deployment`: Contains the code for deploying the trained model in a Flutter mobile app.
- `Image_Crawling`: Scripts to collect images from the web for building the dataset.
- `Colab_Code`: Jupyter notebooks used for training the model on Google Colab.
